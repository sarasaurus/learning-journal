## DAY 3  
Today was difficult.  Got lots of help from classmates and finally figured out answers.  Tried for stretch goal, but was too tired to think clearly.  And am now struggling with this easy task.
tryed to stay focused on important goals and not get lost in trivial ones and I think I did a pretty good job of that.
working on ACP.
that's all.
