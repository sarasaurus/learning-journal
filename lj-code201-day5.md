## Day 5
Today was tough.  I felt good about functions after yesterday, but realised in doing the problems that I really didn't get what they were doing.
labeling my lines was helpful
scott suggested making each thing I did a new line of code with a label explaining what I was doing... that was really helpful. I thhiiiink I;m starting to get it.
It's hard to stare at problems and a screen for so long... at a certain point easy things are hard.
new plan going forward MORE SCREEN BREAKS.  I think just getting up and walking a little will help avoid bashing head against the wall.

###  CSS
ugggggghhhhh the floats and fixed footer are drving me crazy. don't understand why they aren't working.
