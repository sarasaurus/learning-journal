### Learning Journal Day 4  

#### first pair programing
- Being clear about the logical function of variables in your naming is super helpful
-- so instead of:  
    _function nameOfFunction (p1, p2) {  }_  
  __do this__:  _function nameOfFunction (question, answer, trueResponse etc) { }_

it helped   so much!  I saw it help my partner and then used it myself while I was driving

At home I wrote out the functions we had done using only descriptve variables.  It was so helpful!

Working with a partner helped to sound out ideas. and gave a ready source of help if needed.

I definitely need to read up on functions more.  of all the things we are learning JS is the most unfamiliar to me.
