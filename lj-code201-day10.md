#### Day 10  
_Pair Programming_  
- Going forward best practice for wire-framing or scaffolding out HTML is to keep it as simple as possible at first, organize into big general div's or sections/articles
- Also putting CSS that is establishing header/footer, general consistency in one chunk so can easily copy paste between pages
- seperating color and fonts from layout properties, so can change colors and plug and play color ids/classes without affecting layout.
- also seems like it makes sense to start doing more with hierarchy rather than just a billion ids/classes/divs
