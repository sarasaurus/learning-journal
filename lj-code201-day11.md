#### DAY 11
today was tough, figuring out how to use the object constructor, and methods with a more open ended project was really confusing. I tried to follow the demo code but just couldn't wrap my head around it.  I wound up just making it work with what I understood --- global functions.
I wanted to figure it out on my own before leaning on my classmates and ta's... I don't think that was bad, it just meant I got bogged down with some simple things and definitly got a good sense of what syntax I understand and what I don't!
I want to get better at using the console for JS. I think that will help me play with it.
