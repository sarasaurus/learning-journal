## Day 6
created objects!
worked and worked but hit a wall around 6.
I kept working, hoping to push through... but got too tired to work efficiently or with confidence that I wouldn't ruin something I already had.... so  

_note to self:_
  - aim to finish and ACP, Submit by 6-7pm
      - if not done by then, go anyway.  taking a break and coming back either early or in the morning is probably the best bet.


still need to add one last bit  + style && HTML.....

object {

  key: value,
  key: value,

  key: function () {   

    return this.key;
  },

}  

'return' spits you out of a function. _last line always_

bye!
