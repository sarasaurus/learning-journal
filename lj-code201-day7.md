###  day 7
my goal was to take many mini breaks... not sure I succeeded, but I did start the problem before leaving for lunch, which I don't think was bad.  Then I left around 7-730, when I wasn't making headway, which was definitely a good move.
so over all: thumbs up.
Definitely a challenging day.  trying to understand yesterday's syntax, then today's.  Not super excited to add events tomorrow! yay!
